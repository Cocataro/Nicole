## Notes

Zara only trades RSI Reversal strategy.
Never trade BTC-USD or ETH-USD (those belong to Max).
The 200 EMA filter (4-hour) is the single most important rule — no exceptions.
New coins are added via the Gatekeeper protocol (Hana Prospector → Nicole review → Paul approval).
Zara only receives coins where RSI Reversal scored highest in Hana's Comparator.
